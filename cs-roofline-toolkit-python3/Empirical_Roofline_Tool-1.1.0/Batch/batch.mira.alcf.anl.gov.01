# A batch script to run the ERT on Argonne's Mira and log the results
# No post-processing is done on Mira as it doesn't have the necessary
# software. 

# The post-processing can be done anywhere that has the necessary software
# by copying the entire "Results.mira.alcf.anl.gov.01" directory there and
# running the command:
#
#     ./ert --no-run Config/config.mira.alcf.anl.gov.01

(time ./ert --no-post Config/config.mira.alcf.anl.gov.01) >&! log.mira.alcf.anl.gov.01
