In this directory are a set of ERT results generated using the
configuration files in "../Config".  There are both PostScript plots of the
roofline which can be viewed/printed and JSON database files which can be
visualized with the Roofline Visualizer.

  roofline.babbage.nersc.gov.01.*
    Knight's Corner (KNC) node testing only the host and not the MIC

  roofline.babbage.nersc.gov.02.*
    Knight's Corner (KNC) node testing only the MIC and not the host

    IBM Blue Gene/Q node - 16 1600 MHz PowerPC A2 cores

  roofline.titan.ccs.ornl.gov.01.*
    Cray XK7 node - Test only the host processor on the node,
                    16-core 2.2GHz AMD Opteron™ 6274 (Interlagos) processor

  roofline.titan.ccs.ornl.gov.02.*
    Cray XK7 node - Test only the GPU processor on the node,
                    NVIDIA Kepler™accelerator GPU

These results are meant to be representative of the roofline results we
were able to measure.  That said, these are only examples and it may be
possible to obtain better rooflines with different compiler/loader flags,
drivers/kernels, etc.

There are example batch scripts in "../Batch" and corresponding
configuration files in "../Config".

We are actively interested in improved results and how they were obtained.
Please contact us with any results/configurations you feel would improve
these examples.
