The Empirical Roofline Tool, ERT, automatically generates a roofline
data for a given computer. This includes the maximum bandwidth for the
various levels of the memory hierarchy and the maximum gflop rate. This
data is obtained using a variety of "micro-kernels".

The ERT comes with a set of configuration files for a number of
computers/architectures. These configuration file can be adapted to your
local environment and needs to better measure the roofline parameters of
your computer(s).

To find out more about using this tool please read the user's manual,
"ERT_Users_Manual.pdf".

Each of the subdirectories also contains README files with information about
the purpose and contents of the subdirectory.
